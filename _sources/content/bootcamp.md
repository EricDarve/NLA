# Linear Algebra Bootcamp

Welcome to the Linear Algebra Bootcamp! ðŸš€

Ready to sharpen your skills? This chapter is your high-speed training ground for the essential concepts of linear algebra that power everything from data science to quantum mechanics. We'll start with a rapid tour of the fundamentals&emdash;vector spaces, norms, and dot products&emdash;before diving into the heart of the action.

You'll get reacquainted with matrices and the powerful stories they tell through their four fundamental subspaces. Then, we'll unlock the secrets of a matrix's "DNA" with two of the most important ideas in mathematics: the **Eigendecomposition**, which explains how systems evolve over time, and the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, which reveals the pure geometry of transformations.

Whether you're looking for a quick refresher or building your foundation, this bootcamp will get you geared up and ready for the exciting world of numerical linear algebra. Let's get started!
