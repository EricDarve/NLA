# The Core Idea: Projection onto Krylov Subspaces

We established that for large, sparse matrices, our only computationally feasible tool is the sparse matrix-vector product, $v \mapsto Av$. Any method that modifies the matrix $A$ itself, like the dense QR algorithm, is unusable due to "fill-in."

This forces us to ask a new question: How can we find eigenvalues using *only* matrix-vector products?

The answer lies in building a small, dense matrix $H_k$ whose eigenvalues approximate the eigenvalues of $A$. We do this by projecting $A$ onto a carefully chosen low-dimensional subspace.

## Revisiting the Hessenberg Reduction

Let's reconsider the full Hessenberg reduction from our study of direct methods:

$$
A Q = Q H
$$

where $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is orthogonal and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is upper Hessenberg.

Let's look at this equation one column at a time. Let $q_j$ be the $j$-th column of $Q$ and $h_j$ be the $j$-th column of $H$. The $j$-th column of the equation $AQ = QH$ reads:

$$
A q_j = Q h_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i h_{ij}
$$

Because $H$ is upper Hessenberg, $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $i > j+1$. This simplifies the sum dramatically:

$$
A q_j = \sum_{i=1}^{j+1} h_{ij} q_i = h_{1j}q_1 + h_{2j}q_2 + \dots + h_{j,j}q_j + h_{j+1,j}q_{j+1}
$$

We can rearrange this to solve for the "new" vector, $q_{j+1}$:

$$
h_{j+1,j} q_{j+1} = A q_j - \sum_{i=1}^{j} h_{ij} q_i
$$

This equation reveals that the Hessenberg reduction is actually a **Gram-Schmidt-like iterative process**. Starting with an arbitrary unit vector $q_1$:

1.  Compute the vector $v = A q_j$.
2.  Orthogonalize $v$ against the "old" basis vectors $q_1, \dots, q_j$. The coefficients of this orthogonalization are $h_{ij} = q_i^T v$ (since $q_i^T q_k = 0$).
3.  The remaining vector, $w = v - \sum_{i=1}^{j} h_{ij} q_i$, is, by construction, orthogonal to $q_1, \dots, q_j$.
4.  Normalize this vector: $h_{j+1,j} = \|w\|_2$ and $q_{j+1} = w / h_{j+1,j}$.

This is the **Arnoldi iteration**. 

If we run this process for $n$ steps, we build the full matrices $Q$ and $H$. The cost is dominated by the $n$ sparse matvecs and the $O(n^3)$ work of the $n$ growing orthogonalizations. We have simply re-derived the $O(n^3)$ dense Hessenberg reduction, and the sparsity of $A$ has not saved us.

## The Iterative Truncation

The key insight is that it is possible to **stop this process early**.

What if we only run the Arnoldi iteration for $k$ steps, where $k \ll n$?

After $k$ steps, we have produced an orthonormal set of vectors $Q_k = [q_1, \dots, q_k]$ and a small $k \times k$ upper Hessenberg matrix $H_k$, which is the top-left block of the full $H$.

The process generates the following relationship, which is the key to all iterative methods:

$$
\boxed{A Q_k = Q_k H_k + h_{k+1,k} q_{k+1} e_k^T}
$$

where $e_k^T = [0, \dots, 0, 1]$ is the $k$-th standard basis vector. This is known as the **Arnoldi relation**.

* The term $Q_k H_k$ exactly represents the components of $A Q_k$ that lie *within* the subspace spanned by $Q_k.$
* The term $h_{k+1,k} q_{k+1} e_k^T$ is the "remainder" or "residual"â€”the part of $A Q_k$ that points "out" of the subspace.

## The Projection and the Approximation

If we simply ignore the residual term (which we hope is small), we get an approximation:

$$
A Q_k \approx Q_k H_k
$$

This suggests that $A$ behaves like $H_k$ *when restricted to the subspace $\text{span}(Q_k)$*. Let's make this formal by left-multiplying the Arnoldi relation by $Q_k^T$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_k^T (A Q_k) &= Q_k^T (Q_k H_k + h_{k+1,k} q_{k+1} e_k^T) \\
Q_k^T A Q_k &= (Q_k^T Q_k) H_k + h_{k+1,k} (Q_k^T q_{k+1}) e_k^T
\end{aligned}
$$

By construction, $Q_k$ is orthonormal, so $Q_k^T Q_k = I_k$. Also, $q_{k+1}$ is orthogonal to all columns in $Q_k$, so $Q_k^T q_{k+1} = \mathbf{0}$. The equation simplifies perfectly:

$$
H_k = Q_k^T A Q_k
$$

This $k \times k$ matrix $H_k$ is the **Rayleigh-Ritz projection** of $A$ onto the subspace spanned by $Q_k$.

This subspace, $\mathcal{K}_k(A, q_1) = \text{span}\{q_1, Aq_1, A^2q_1, \dots, A^{k-1}q_1\}$, is called the **Krylov subspace** of degree $k$ generated by $A$ and $q_1$. 

The Arnoldi iteration is a numerically stable way to build an orthonormal basis for this subspace.

## The Iterative Eigensolver Strategy

This defines the general strategy for all modern iterative eigensolvers:

1.  **Build Subspace:** Choose a starting vector $q_1$ and run the Arnoldi iteration for $k$ steps to build an orthonormal basis $Q_k$ for the Krylov subspace $\mathcal{K}_k$ and the $k \times k$ Hessenberg projection $H_k = Q_k^T A Q_k$.
2.  **Solve Small Problem:** Compute the eigenvalues of the *small, dense* matrix $H_k$ using a standard method (e.g., the QR iteration algorithm). Let these eigenvalues be $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_k$. These are called the **Ritz values**.
3.  **Check Convergence:** These Ritz values are our approximations for the eigenvalues of $A$. We can check their associated residual error (which, as we will see, is related to the $h_{k+1,k}$ term) to see if they are "good enough."
4.  **Iterate:** If not converged, we can expand the subspace (increase $k$) and repeat.

The total cost is dominated by the $k$ sparse matrix-vector products, at $O(k \cdot nnz(A)) \approx O(kn)$, and the $k$ orthogonalization steps, at $O(k^2 n)$. As long as $k \ll n$, this cost is vastly lower than the $O(n^3)$ cost of a direct method.

In the special (and very common) case that $A$ is symmetric, the projected matrix $H_k$ will also be symmetric. A symmetric Hessenberg matrix is **tridiagonal**. This simplification of the Arnoldi iteration is known as the **Lanczos iteration**, which is even more efficient.
