# CME 302 Class Notes

- [CME 302](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/178134)
- Built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and Quartz.

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.

### How to generate the static web pages

This will start a local web server to run your Quartz on your computer. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/` to view it.
