- Null space: $N(A) = \{x \,|\, Ax = 0\}$.
- Column space or range: $R(A) = \{y \,|\, y = Ax\}$.
- Row space: $R(A^T)$.
- Null space of $A^T$: $N(A^T)$.

The row space and column space have the same dimension. It's called the rank $r$ of the matrix.

Rank-nullity theorem: The dimension of the null space is related to the dimension of the range:
$$
\text{dim}(R(A)) + \text{dim}(N(A)) = n
$$

Orthogonal complement theorem: $R(A)^\perp = N(A^T)$ (and similarly for $A^T$).
