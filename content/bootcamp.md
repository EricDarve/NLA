# Linear Algebra Bootcamp

Welcome to the Linear Algebra Bootcamp! ðŸš€

This chapter is your high-speed training ground for the essential concepts of linear algebra that power everything from data science to quantum mechanics. We'll start with a rapid tour of the fundamentalsâ€”vector spaces, norms, and dot productsâ€”before diving into the core of the action.

You'll get reacquainted with matrices and the powerful stories they tell through their four fundamental subspaces. Then, we'll unlock the secrets of a matrix's "DNA" with two of the most important tools in mathematics: the **Eigendecomposition**, which explains how systems evolve, and the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, which reveals the pure geometry of transformations.

Whether you need a quick refresher or are building your foundation from scratch, this bootcamp will get you geared up for the exciting world of numerical linear algebra. Let's get started!
