- [[Why eigenvalues?]]
	- We give some examples of operation that become very simple to compute when we use eigenvalues.
- [[Eigenvalues cannot be computed exactly]]
	- We show that computing eigenvalues is difficult and cannot be done exactly.
	- However, we do have approximate but very fast and accurate algorithms that will give us excellent approximations, with errors down to the [[Floating point arithmetic and unit roundoff error|unit roundoff error]] $u$.
- [[Method of power iteration]]
	- Forms the basis of advanced methods: QR iteration
	- Simple but only works marginally well
	- Will be accelerated and improved to become the QR iteration
