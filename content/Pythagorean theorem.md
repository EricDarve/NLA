- Works in any dimension!
- Allows measuring the 2-norm of a vector by measuring the length of its components along orthogonal axes.
- Take $x = u + v$ where $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal. Then:
$$
\|x\|_2^2 = \|u\|_2^2 + \|v\|_2^2
$$
- Note that this is true for any decomposition of $x$ as long as $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal.
