The QR factorization is an essential tool in NLA. It is used in many applications including Least-Squares, computing eigenvalues and singular values, and solving sparse linear systems using iterative methods.

- [[QR factorization]]
	- $A = QR$ with $Q$ orthogonal and $R$ upper triangular.
- [[Householder transformation]]
	- The most computationally efficient technique to calculate a QR factorization
	- Based on computing an orthogonal reflection
- [[Applying a Householder transformation]]
	- We explain how to apply a Householder transformation in a computationally efficient way.
- [[QR using Householder transformations]]
	- Explains how [[Householder transformation|Householder transformations]] can be used to compute the [[QR factorization]].
