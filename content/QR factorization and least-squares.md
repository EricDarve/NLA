The QR factorization is an essential tool in NLA. It is used in many applications including Least-Squares, computing eigenvalues and singular values, and solving sparse linear systems using iterative methods.

- [[QR factorization]]
	- $A = QR$ with $Q$ orthogonal and $R$ upper triangular.
- [[Householder transformation]]
	- The most computationally efficient technique to calculate a QR factorization
	- Based on computing an orthogonal reflection
- [[Applying a Householder transformation]]
	- We explain how to apply a Householder transformation in a computationally efficient way.
- [[QR using Householder transformations]]
	- Explains how [[Householder transformation|Householder transformations]] can be used to compute the [[QR factorization]].
- [[QR using Givens transformations]]
	- Householder allows to zero out an entire column with a single orthogonal transformation.
	- Givens only zeros out a single entry. This can be useful for sparse or matrices with a special sparsity pattern.
	- The total cost is $O(n^3)$. This is similar to Householder.
- [[Gram-Schmidt]]
	- Useful for many applications in particular for iterative methods to solve linear systems and compute eigenvalues.
	- Computationally very efficient when $A$ is thin.
- [[Uniqueness of the QR factorization]]
	- We show that the QR factorization is unique if we require that $r_{ii} > 0$.
- [[Least-squares problems]]
	- Definition of least-squares.
	- Equivalent form using a linear system.
- [[Method of normal equation]]
	- This method is the simplest.
	- It requires a [[Cholesky factorization]] factorization.
	- However, the [[Conditioning of a linear system|condition]] number of the linear system can be very large, causing a loss in accuracy.
- [[Least-squares solution using QR]]
	- This is the recommended solution.
	- It has a low computational cost in general.
	- The condition number is as low as possible and the accuracy is high.
- [[Least-squares solution using SVD]]
	- This method is more expensive but is required when $A$ is not full column rank.
	- In that case, the other methods fail.
