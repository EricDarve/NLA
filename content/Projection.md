- We can use the dot product and 2-norm to project a vector onto another.
- Projection of $y$ unto $x$
	- Signed scalar projection: $x^T y / \|x\|_2$
	- Vector projection: 
$$
\frac{x^T y}{\|x\|_2^2} \: x
$$
- If $x$ is a unit vector ($\|x\|_2=1$), we simply have that the projection is equal to to $x^Ty$.
