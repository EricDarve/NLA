- Style of class and what to expect
	- This class will require some proof writing
	- What is numerical linear algebra?
		- Example: difference between the existence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and how to compute them
	- A class on numerical methods covers:
		- Algorithms to solve a mathematical problem
		- Computational cost
		- Many algorithms are approximate; what is the error? how can it be controlled? how can it be estimated?
		- Roundoff errors and stability: how do small errors in the data and during the calculation affect the final result?
		- There will be some computer programming, but this is not the main focus
		- We won't discuss applications in detail
		- The focus is on the algorithms, computational cost, and error analysis
- Content of class
