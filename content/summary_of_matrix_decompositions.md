# Summary of Matrix Decompositions

Here is a comparison of the key matrix decompositions related to eigenvalues and singular values.

| Decomposition | Requirements for Existence | Components & Properties | Interpretation & Applications | Relation to Others |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schur Decomposition** <br> $A = Q T Q^H$ | Exists for **any** square complex matrix $A$. | **Q**: Unitary ($Q^H Q = I$). <br> **T**: Upper triangular. <br> Diagonal of T contains the eigenvalues of A. | **Interpretation**: Any linear transformation is unitarily similar to a triangular one. <br> **Applications**: Numerically stable computation of all eigenvalues. | This is the general form from which eigendecomposition is a special case. |
| **Real Schur Decomposition** <br> $A = Q S Q^T$ | Exists for **any** square real matrix $A$. | **Q**: Real orthogonal ($Q^T Q = I$). <br> **S**: Real quasi-triangular (block upper triangular). <br> 1x1 diagonal blocks are real eigenvalues; 2x2 blocks correspond to complex conjugate eigenvalues. | **Interpretation**: Represents any real transformation in a basis that makes it "as triangular as possible" using only real numbers. <br> **Applications**: Stable eigenvalue computation in real arithmetic. | The real-valued equivalent of the complex Schur decomposition. |
| **Eigendecomposition** <br> $A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$ | Exists only for **diagonalizable** matrices (those with $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors). | **X**: Invertible matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors. <br> **$\Lambda$**: Diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. <br> $X$ is not guaranteed to be unitary. | **Interpretation**: The transformation is a pure scaling along the eigenvector axes. Associated with "Time" and the evolution of dynamical systems ($A^k$). <br> **Applications**: Solving linear differential equations, analyzing stability, computing matrix powers. | A special case of the Schur decomposition where the triangular matrix $T$ is diagonal. |
| **Unitary Diagonalization** <br> $A = Q \Lambda Q^H$ | Exists only for **normal** matrices ($A A^H = A^H A$). | **Q**: Unitary matrix whose columns are an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. <br> **$\Lambda$**: Diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. | **Interpretation**: The transformation is a pure scaling along a set of *orthogonal* axes. <br> **Applications**: Quantum mechanics, signal processing. | The ideal form of both the Schur and eigendecomposition. Occurs when the matrix is normal. |
| **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** <br> $A = U \Sigma V^T$ | Exists for **any** $m \times n$ matrix $A$, real or complex. | **U**: Unitary/Orthogonal matrix ($m \times m$) of left singular vectors. <br> **V**: Unitary/Orthogonal matrix ($n \times n$) of right singular vectors. <br> **$\Sigma$**: Rectangular diagonal matrix of non-negative singular values. | **Interpretation**: Decomposes any transformation into rotation, scaling, and another rotation. Associated with "Space" and the geometry of the transformation. <br> **Applications**: PCA, low-rank approximation, computing pseudoinverses, determining rank and condition number. | Generalizes eigendecomposition to any matrix. The singular values of A are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $A^T A$ and $A A^T$. |
