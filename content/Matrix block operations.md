Let's consider a matrix $A$ presented in block form. For simplicity, we'll focus on a $2 \times 2$ block matrix:
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\ A_{21} & A_{22} \end{pmatrix},
$$
where $A_{11}$, $A_{12}$, $A_{21}$, and $A_{22}$ are matrices themselves.

Operations on block matrices can be performed much like operations on scalar matrices. This means we can add, subtract, and multiply block matrices by treating each block as an individual element, provided the dimensions of the blocks are compatible.

**Addition of Block Matrices**
- For example, when adding two block matrices, we simply add their corresponding blocks:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\ A_{21} & A_{22} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} B_{11} & B_{12} \\ B_{21} & B_{22} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} A_{11} + B_{11} & A_{12} + B_{12} \\ A_{21} + B_{21} & A_{22} + B_{22} \end{pmatrix}.
$$
- Each block addition $A_{ij} + B_{ij}$ is performed using standard matrix addition rules.

**Multiplication of Block Matrices**

Similarly, we can multiply two block matrices using block multiplication rules:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\ A_{21} & A_{22} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B_{11} & B_{12} \\ B_{21} & B_{22} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} A_{11}B_{11} + A_{12}B_{21} & A_{11}B_{12} + A_{12}B_{22} \\ A_{21}B_{11} + A_{22}B_{21} & A_{21}B_{12} + A_{22}B_{22} \end{pmatrix},
$$
where each product like $A_{11}B_{11}$ is a standard matrix multiplication between the blocks $A_{11}$ and $B_{11}$.

**Advantages of Using Block Notation**

Utilizing block notation offers several benefits:

1. **Simplification of Algebraic Manipulations:** It allows us to handle complex matrix operations more manageably by breaking down large matrices into smaller, more tractable blocks.
2. **Compact Representation:** Block notation provides a concise way to represent operations, which is especially useful in theoretical derivations and proofs.
3. **Revealing Structure:** It highlights the inherent structure within matrices, such as sparsity or patterns, which can be exploited for computational efficiency.

**Consistency with Element-wise Operations**

When we compute the product of two matrices using standard element-wise notation:
$$
[AB]_{ij} = \sum_k A_{ik} B_{kj},
$$
we obtain the same result as when using block notation.
