A matrix $A \in \mathbb C^{n \times n}$ is unitarily diagonalizable if there is a unitary matrix $Q$ and a diagonal matrix $\Lambda$ so that
$$
A = Q \Lambda Q^H
$$

Definition: $A$ is normal if and only if $A^H A = A A^H$.

Property: a matrix is normal if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable.
